    <h1> German Case Study </h1>

  <div class='Description'>
    <p>  Germany uses a unique system called mixed-member proportional representation in their parliament (Bundestag).<br><br>
      <h2> Ballot</h2><br>
      German voters are presented with a ballot with two different sides to it. One side contains a list of candidates where a voter selects the candidate they want to represent their local area, much like in a British parliamentary election or the election for congresspeople in the USA. However, the other side of the ballot contains a list of parties, such as in a <a href = '/Info_pages/PR.hmtl'> list proportional representation </a> system.<br><br>
      <h2>Assigning the seats</h2><br>
      There are a base number of 598 seats in the Bundestag, where 50%(299) are constituency representatives elected through a <a href = '/Info_pages/FPTP.hmtl'>first-past-the-post</a> system and 50%(299) are party delegates elected through a <a href = '/Info_pages/PR.hmtl'> list proportional representation </a>system. <br><br>
      However, the Bundestag doesn't normally just have 598 seats, for example, after 2013 there were 631 seats in Bundestag, including 33 overhang seats. The overhang seats are seats that are added to the Bundestag so that all parties are proportionally represented.This is because a party may get a higher percentage of the vote in the first vote for local candidates than in the second party vote, meaning that party becomes <b> over-represented</b> in the Bundestag, so seats are added and awrded to the other parties to correct for this.<br><br>
      For example, in the 2013 election the CDU/CSU party got 45.3% of the local vote and 41.5% of the party vote, meaning their party got 16 more seats than it should have proportionally had in the Bundestag, meaning 17 seats were added and distributed between the other parties to make it fair.
