  <div class='Description'>
    <h2> Overview </h2><br>
    <p> First Past the Post is an electoral system which is used in many countries, such as the UK and USA, to elect candidates to seats.

       The ballot works by simply marking the one candidate you wish to vote for, normally using an ‘X’. All ballots in that election will be collected and counted and the candidate with the most votes will win the seat.
       <br><br>
       The main problem with First Past The Post is <b> tactical voting</b>, where a person feels they have to vote for a popular party they don't like, in order to stop a worse party from gaining power.
      <br> For example, imagine you live in a country with 2 main parties - The Human Party and The Animal Party.
      Your views may best align with The Cat Party, but they only got 12% in the last election, and you may dislike The Animal Party but absolutely hate The Human Party. This means you may feel forced to vote for The Animal Party to stop The Human Party from winning.
      If enough people do this, The Cat Party may get only 8% of the vote, which means in the next election more people vote tactically, so they only get 3% of the vote, causing more people to vote tactically, creating a cycle. This inevitably creates a two-party system, such as in the USA and UK, meaning lots of people are not voting for a party they really want to represent them.
