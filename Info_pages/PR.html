    <h1> List Proportional Representation (PR) </h1>

  <div class='Description'>
    <p> Proportional Representation is a system of electing representatives used in over 80 countries including Israel and the Netherlands.
      The voters are presented with a ballot where they mark the name of the party they wish to vote for. Each party will be given seats based on the percentage of votes they receive and these seats are assigned to people using lists of candidates that the parties make before the election.
      Sometimes the lists are published before the election or on the ballot, but in some counties the lists are only known by party officials. There is normally a certain minimum % of the vote that a party needs to get in order to get any seats at all.
